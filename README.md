# Spring-Framework-5

This brand-new generation of the framework is ready for 2018 and beyond:
with support for JDK 9 and the Java EE 8 API level (e.g. Servlet 4.0), as well 
as comprehensive integration with Reactor 3.1, JUnit 5, and the Kotlin language. 
On top of that all, Spring Framework 5 comes with many functional API variants and
introduces a dedicated reactive web framework called Spring WebFlux, 
next to a revised version of our Servlet-based web framework Spring MVC.
